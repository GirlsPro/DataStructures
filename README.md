**DS Visual** - *data structures visualizer* - service for learning base abstract data types.

**Advantages:**
- switch between different levels of abstraction and visualize various implementations of the specific abstract data type;
- perform main operations on the ADT and see their algorithm step by step;
- combine several implementations on the screen at the same time for more convenient comparison.

Here is a short [demo video](https://github.com/sandragg/ds-visual/blob/master/ds-visual.mov)!
